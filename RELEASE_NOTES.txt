  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   Imprudence 1.3.0 beta 4 is a hotfix release to fix a serious bug
   when rezzing objects from your inventory in Second Life while the
   Build window is open.


   CHANGES

     * The following features from the Advanced Build Options window
       have been removed to prevent unintentional modification of
       objects rezzed from your inventory:

        - "Settings" and "Texture" control the default settings and
          textures for newly created prims.

        - Ability to embed an inventory item into newly created prims.

     * The following change in 1.3.0 beta 3 has been reverted, to
       avoid possible negative effects on private/group voice
       conversations:

       - If the current region does not have any support for voice
         chat (e.g. OpenSim regions with no voice module), the viewer
         will temporarily deactivate voice chat and hide the voice
         chat controls on the toolbar. The viewer will check again for
         voice chat again whenever you move to another parcel.

     * Fixed the "Show Selection Outlines" checkbox in the Advanced
       Build Options window not working correctly.

   RELEASE HIGHLIGHTS

     * Improved OpenSim support.

        - Support for up to 100 groups, 99% hollow prims, 1% hole
          size, megaprims up to 256m in size, and prim Z position up
          to 10km. Thanks to the Hippo Viewer for these improvements!

        - Implemented the "--grid" command line flag to select a grid
          to login to by name, e.g. "--grid osgrid --login Firstname
          Lastname Password". Thanks, Armin!

        - Various links now go to the proper web page for the current
          grid, instead of always a Second Life web page: F1 Help,
          "Sign up for account", "Forgot your name or password?".
          Thanks, Armin!

        - The Search window's Groups tab has been reverted to a
          non-web based version, like the Hippo Viewer has. The All
          tab is also no longer web based, but a new "All (web)" tab
          has been added for the web based search. Thanks to the Hippo
          Viewer and McCabe for this!

        - The "All (web)" Search tab now uses metaverseink.com for
          searches on non-Second Life grids. Thanks, McCabe!

     * Built-in Animation Overrider (View > AO, Ctrl-Shift-O). See our
       "Animation Overrider" wiki page for full details. Thanks to
       Emerald Viewer for this feature, and McCabe for porting and
       improving it!

     * IM Autoresponse (Prefences > Communication > IM Response
       Options). The viewer can now perform a variety of actions when
       you receive an Instant Message, such as sending a response
       automatically. Thanks to Emerald Viewer for this feature, and
       McCabe for porting it!

     * Tools > Advanced Build Options (Ctrl-Shift-B). The old "Grid
       Options" window has been renamed and extended with a bunch of
       great new options and features to help builders. See our
       "Advanced Build Options" wiki page for full details. Thanks to
       McCabe for setting up the Advanced Build Options window.

        - "Pivot Point" and "Show axis on root prim" affect the
          placement of the 3D build axes widget. Thanks to the Emerald
          Viewer for this feature!

        - "Rez objects using land group" automatically rezzes objects
          using the correct group for the land, if you are a member.
          Thanks to the Emerald Viewer for this feature!

        - "Edit object decimal places" controls the numerical
          precision shown for object position, rotation, and size.
          Thanks to the Cool VL Viewer for this feature!

        - "Object Size", "Settings", and "Texture" controls the
          default settings for newly created prims. Thanks to the
          Emerald Viewer for this feature!

        - Ability to embed an inventory item into newly created
          prims. Thanks to the Emerald Viewer for this feature!

     * To make the viewer compliant with the Second Life Policy on
       Third-Party Viewers, the object export feature no longer
       downloads textures from Second Life. Other grids are not
       affected. (Ported from version 1.2.2.)


   KNOWN ISSUES

     * Textures on other avatars may flicker or appear corrupted on
       your computer, if they are using viewers based on Second Life
       1.22 or earlier. This is due to a change in avatar texture
       format introduced in Second Life 1.23. We are investigating
       solutions to this problem.

     * Textures may not load fully or may appear corrupted when using
       OpenJPEG when "Use HTTP Textures" is enabled. If you want to
       benefit from HTTP textures in this release, you should copy the
       "libkdu" and "libllkdu" from a Second Life 1.23.5 installation
       to the corresponding location within the Imprudence directory.

     * Due to an oversight, the "World > Buy OS$" menu item is active
       on OpenSim in this release, but will be disabled in the future
       to prevent confusion on grids that don't support currencies.

     * When your avatar is sitting on an object, it may appear
       invisible to users of older viewers, such as Hippo Viewer
       version 5.0.1.

     * In the grid manager, the "Get Grid Info" button does not work
       for OpenSim-based grids unless the login URI has a trailing
       slash ("/"). You should end login URIs for OpenSim-based grids
       with a trailing slash, e.g. "http://osgrid.org:8002/", not
       "http://osgrid.org:8002".


   CHANGES

     In addition to the Release Highlights above, this version of
     Imprudence also includes the following changes, as compared to
     Imprudence 1.3.0 beta 2.


     FEATURES / IMPROVEMENTS

       * Added a new "Advanced" section in Preferences, with several
         new options. Thanks, McCabe!

          - "Disable Login/Logout Screens". When this option is checked,
            the viewer will not show the progress bar screen when
            logging in, logging out, or quitting the viewer.

          - "Disable Teleport Screens". When this option is checked, the
            viewer will not show the progress bar screen when
            teleporting.

          - "Show Client Names in Name Tag" and "Broadcast Your Client
            Name to Others". These control the Client Identification
            feature. (See the wiki for more information.)

          - "Enable Shadows". This enables experimental support for
            dynamic shadow rendering in the viewer. WARNING: This is
            potentially unstable and requires a very good video card.

          - "Use HTTP Textures". This enables support for downloading
            textures via HTTP when available. This can improve the
            speed and reliability of texture downloads when connected
            to a service that supports HTTP textures, such as OpenSim
            0.6.9-RC2 or later. If the service does not support HTTP
            textures (such as Second Life or older OpenSim versions),
            this option has no benefit.

          - "Increase rez speed via draw distance stepping". This
            controls the "SpeedRez" feature added in 1.3.0 beta 2.
            There is also an option to adjust the time between draw
            distance steps.

          - "Stand when editing appearance". When turned off, you will
            no longer Stand Up when you edit your avatar appearance
            while sitting. (Currently the "turn around" animation still
            plays, but that behavior will likely change in the future.)

       * The inventory window title now remembers the inventory count
         from your previous session, and indicates how many items are
         still remaining to fetch. Thanks to Emerald Viewer for this
         feature!

       * The script editor now has tooltips for new LSL features added
         in SL serve 1.38 (prim media and linkset functions). Thanks
         to Linden Lab and McCabe!

       * Tweaked the avatar height calculator in the Appearance window
         to be more accurate, using values from SNOW-197. Thanks to
         Archimedies Plutonian, Soft Linden, McCabe, and Jacek!

       * Objects with no name (or unknown name) now appear as ">>" in
         chat, instead of appearing as "no name". Thanks, McCabe!

       * If the current region does not have any support for voice
         chat (e.g. OpenSim regions with no voice module), the viewer
         will temporarily deactivate voice chat and hide the voice
         chat controls on the toolbar. The viewer will check again for
         voice chat again whenever you move to another parcel.

       * The viewer will deactivate voice chat for the current session
         if the SLVoice program is not found, rather than repeatedly
         checking for it. (See our "How to Re-enable Voice Chat" wiki
         page for instructions for installing SLVoice.)

       * By default, the statistics window (Ctrl-Shift-1) no longer
         hides when entering Mouselook mode. You can adjust this
         behavior with the ShowStatusBarInMouselook debug setting.

       * Tooltips now disappear when you type, to prevent them from
         obscuring the UI while typing (SNOW-384). Thanks for the
         patch, Ardy Lay!

       * Tweaked some ugly layouts in several avatar profile tabs and
         Search window tabs. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Uploads that cost nothing (on OpenSim) now say "free" instead
         of "L$0". Thanks to the Hippo Viewer for this!


     BUG FIXES

       * Fixed a bug where some objects would be invisible after a
         very long-distance teleport (#239). Thanks, Armin!

       * Fixed the "Advanced > Animation List" window not updating.
         Thanks, McCabe!

       * Fixed "Advanced > Phantom Avatar" not working correctly on
         Second Life. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Fixed some UI layout problems in the login screen and avatar
         profile window when the viewer is set to certain non-English
         languages (#192, #231). Thanks, Jacek and McCabe!

       * Fixed a crash in the script editor related to OpenSim
         reporting a syntax error with a negative line number (#245).
         Thanks, McCabe!

       * Fixed a crash caused by some malformed animations (SNOW-484).
         Thanks to Robin Cornelius for the patch!

       * Fixed a crash when quitting, related to the LLAgent class
         destructor. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Fixed the "Quit" button not working in the dialog that
         informs you of a lost connection (#199). Thanks, McCabe!

       * Fixed a rare crash in the payment dialog in laggy situations.
         Thanks to to Hippo Viewer for the fix!

       * The "File > Import + Upload" menu item no longer erroneously
         shows "(L$10 per texture)" when connected to OpenSim. Thanks,
         McCabe!

       * Fixed several hardcoded references to Second Life and the
         Second Life website. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Repositioned the "Temporary Image" checkbox on the image
         upload window so it doesn't extend beyond the window. Thanks,
         McCabe!

       * Fixed an ambiguous use of NULL in the media code which may
         have caused crashes for 64-bit Linux users. Thanks, Armin!


     OTHER CHANGES

       * "Sub-Unit Snapping" is now enabled by default. You can
         toggle it in the "Tools > Advanced Build Options" window
         (Ctrl-Shift-O).

       * When connected to grids other than Second Life, the currency
         symbol is now "OS$" instead of "L$" (#237).

       * As a temporary measure, you can now only purchase currency in
         the viewer when connected to Second Life. On OpenSim, the
         "L$" button is hidden and clicking your "OS$" amount will not
         open the window to buy currency. This functionality will be
         re-enabled when we are certain it will work correctly on
         OpenSim, and can detect whether the grid supports it.

       * Renamed some tabs in the Profile window: "2nd Life" and "1st
         Life" are now "Avatar" and "Real Life". Thanks, McCabe!

       * The OpenAL library for Linux (32-bit and 64-bit) has been
         updated to version 1.11.753. This should hopefully address
         some issues related to PulseAudio. Thanks, Armin!

       * The viewer now sends the correct version number when loading
         login splash page. It now sends the Imprudence version,
         instead of the version of Second Life it was based on.
         (Ported from version 1.2.2.)

  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   Imprudence 1.2.2 is a small maintenance release to attempt to make
   the viewer compliant with the new Second Life Terms of Service and
   the Policy on Third Party Viewers.

   Please see the Imprudence 1.2.0 Release Notes for information about
   the changes in Imprudence 1.2.


   CHANGES

     * The object export feature no longer downloads textures from
       Second Life. Other grids are not affected.

     * The viewer now sends the correct version number when loading
       login splash page. It now sends the Imprudence version, instead
       of the version of Second Life it was based on.

   RELEASE HIGHLIGHTS

     * Temporary (Free) Texture Uploads. When uploading an image,
       select "Temporary Image (Free)" to upload it for free, but with
       some caveats (see below). Thanks to the Emerald viewer for this
       feature, and Armin for porting it!

        - Temporary textures are intended for testing and preview
          purposes only. They exist only on the sim they are uploaded
          to, will disappear from your inventory when you log off, and
          may disappear from the sim when it restarts.

     * Breast Physics. By popular demand, we have ported breast
       physics simulation (i.e. jiggly boobs) from the Emerald Viewer.
       Thanks to Danny Nolan and the Emerald devs for creating this
       feature, and Armin for porting it!

        - Currently, this feature can only be configured via Debug
          Settings: EmeraldBreastPhysicsToggle (to disable/enable the
          feature entirely), EmeraldBoobMass, EmeraldBoobHardness,
          etc.

     * SpeedRez. After teleporting, the viewer will temporarily
       decrease the draw distance to encourage nearby objects and 
       textures to rez first. Thanks for the patch, Henri Beauchamp!

        - You can disable this feature by setting the SpeedRez debug
          setting to FALSE, or adjust the timing by editing the
          SpeedRezInterval debug setting (smaller numbers restore the
          old draw distance sooner).

     * Building hotkeys to cycle through prims in a link set
       (SNOW-97). See the "Tools > Select Linked Parts" menu. Thanks
       for the patch, Thickbrick Sleaford!


   KNOWN ISSUES

     * Linux: The viewer may crash on some Ubuntu Karmic 64-bit
       installs, most likely due to a bug in glib2. As a work around,
       users affected by this issue can modify the "imprudence" launch
       script to add the following code near the top of the script
       (for example on the second line):

         export LL_WRAPPER='strace -o /dev/null'

     * All known issues listed for 1.3.0 beta 1 still apply to this
       this version.


   CHANGES

     In addition to the Release Highlights above, this version of
     Imprudence also includes the following changes, as compared to
     Imprudence 1.3.0 beta 1.


     FEATURES / IMPROVEMENTS

       * Opening SLURLs ("secondlife://...") from another application
         is now handled nicely on Linux. If Imprudence is already
         running, the SLURL will open in the current instance of
         Imprudence. Otherwise, it will launch a new instance of
         Imprudence. Thanks, Armin!

       * The notecard editor now has Search/Replace functionality.
         Thanks for the patch, Kitty Barnett!

       * The notecard editor now has an "Edit" menu. Thanks for the
         patch, Henri Beauchamp!

       * The password field on the login screen now uses solid black
         circles (•) instead of asterisks (*), for a cleaner look.
         Thanks, Geneko Nemeth!

       * Added PrivateLookAtTarget debug setting. When enabled, the
         viewer will no longer tell other users where your avatar is
         looking. Thanks, Armin!


     BUG FIXES

       * Fixed: Possible crash related to ShowLookAt targets. Thanks, Armin!

       * Fixed: Pie menu remains after switch to Mouselook (VWR-2425).
         Thanks for the patch, Kitty Barnett!

       * Fixed: Some menu entries were missing from the Advanced menu.
         Thanks, Jacek!

          - Advanced > UI > Use default system color picker
          - Advanced > UI > Show search panel in overlay bar
          - Advanced > UI > Show Matrices
          - Advanced > XUI > Font Test...

       * Fixed: Clicking the "Advanced > UI > Double-Click Auto-Pilot"
         menu entry would crash the viewer, so it has been removed.
         (As of Imprudence 1.2, double-click autopilot is configured
         in "Preferences > Input & Camera.) Thanks, Jacek!

       * Applied several bug fixes from Henri Beauchamp. Thanks, Henri!

          - Fixed: The viewer would sometimes crash when touching or
            focusing the camera on an object that was being rezzed.

          - Fixed: The viewer did not properly use the .tga file
            extension when saving textures to your computer.

          - Fixed: The viewer would sometimes crash when encountering
            avatars using "extra" attachment points (multiple
            attachments on the same body part).

       * Fixed: Some pop-up notifications behaved incorrectly: Build
         Math Expressions help pop-ups, and the "Restore to Last
         Position" warning.

       * Fixed: Several cases where the viewer could pause or freeze
         when downloading textures (SNOW-196, SNOW-408, SNOW-434,
         SNOW-435, SNOW-485). Thanks for the patches, Aleric
         Inglewood, Merov Linden, Robin Cornelius, and Vex Streeter!


     OTHER CHANGES

       * ELFIO has been reactivated on 64-bit Linux. It had been
         disabled in 1.3.0 beta 1 as a possible fix for a crash for
         some 64-bit Linux users, but the problem turned out to be
         something else (see Known Issues, above). Thank, Armin!

       * Linux: You can now disable disable DBUS support by passing
         the "--disableDBUS" command line option or setting the
         "DisableDBUS" Debug Setting to TRUE. This is meant as a
         work-around for users who crash when using DBUS. Thank,
         Armin!

       * The pre-packaged 32-bit GStreamer plugins will be now be
         available to GStreamer when running the 32-bit Linux build on
         a 64-bit Linux system. Thank, Armin!

       * To save developers' time and effort, the ChangeLog.txt file
         is now automatically generated from Git commit messages,
         instead of being edited by hand. Thanks, Jacek!

  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


   RELEASE HIGHLIGHTS

     * Textures and objects now rez more quickly, due to improved
       texture and object engines from Snowglobe. Thanks to the
       Snowglobe devs for creating it, and Armin and Jacek for porting
       it!

     * Imprudence's code base has been updated to Second Life 1.23.5.
       That means Imprudence has gained most of the new features and
       bug fixes from SL 1.23. Thanks to Linden Lab for writing it,
       and to Jacek, McCabe, and Armin for their hard work merging it!
       Thanks also to Lilly Zenovka for her assistance.

     * Optional legacy pie menus. Enable "Preferences > General > Use
       legacy pie menus" to switch to a pie menu layout similar to SL
       1.22 and earlier. Thanks, McCabe!

     * Clothing layer protection and client identification from
       Meerkat/Emerald. See the Client Identification page on our wiki
       for information about these features. Thanks to the Meerkat and
       Emerald teams for creating them, and Armin for porting them!


   KNOWN ISSUES

     * Imprudence may crash on Linux when changing "Antialiasing" or
       "Anisotropic Filtering" in "Preferences > Graphics > Hardware
       Settings".

        - This is a known bug in SL 1.23 (VWR-13286). We will try our
          best to fix it.

        - As a work around, you can open "Advanced > Debug Settings",
          modify RenderFSAASamples (antialiasing) and
          RenderAnisotropic (anisotropic filtering), then restart the
          viewer.

     * The "View > Web Browser" menu entry does not work.

     * Legacy pie menus always appear in English, even if you are
       using another language.

     * The "File > Import + Upload" menu item's price always says
       "L$10 per texture", even when uploads are actually free, such
       as on OpenSim.


   CHANGES

     In addition to the Release Highlights above, this version of
     Imprudence also includes the following changes, as compared to
     Imprudence 1.2.1.


     FEATURES / IMPROVEMENTS

       * You can now type in an optional message when paying L$ to a
         Resident (SNOW-436, formerly VWR-9597). The message will
         appear in that Resident's transaction history online. Thanks,
         Jacek!

          - The layout for the Pay Resident and Pay Object windows
            have been cleaned up, too. Thanks, Jacek!

       * You can now adjust numerical sliders with the mouse wheel.
         Position the mouse pointer over a slider (e.g. sound volume,
         draw distance, etc.) and scroll the mouse wheel up and down.
         Thanks, Armin!

          - You can change the direction and speed by editing the
            SliderScrollWheelMultiplier debug setting. Thanks, Jacek!

       * In the IM window, the "Profile" button now has a drop-down
         menu with "Pay" and "Offer Teleport" options. Thanks, McCabe!

       * User profiles now have a "Copy Key" button to copy that
         user's key (agent UUID) to your clipboard. You can then paste
         it into a script, for example. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Color chooser widgets now display opacity in a way that makes
         sense. Thanks, Geneko Nemeth!

       * The Script editor's Help menu now has a link to the
         Autoscript scripting helper, to help generate .

       * You can now drag-and-drop inventory items anywhere on
         someone's profile to send them. In Imprudence 1.2, you had to
         drag to specific area in the bottom right corner. Thanks,
         McCabe!

       * There is now a new debug setting to save inventory scripts as
         Mono (SNOW-378). If you enable SaveInventoryScriptsAsMono in
         Debug Settings, new scripts that you create in your inventory
         will default to Mono. Thanks, Henri Beauchamp!

       * You can now set a custom "world search" URL to use instead of
         SL's search pages. See "Preferences > Web > World Search".
         This is mostly useful for users of third-party grids. We hope
         to provide per-grid search URLs in the future.


     BUG FIXES

       * Fixed the login screen not allowing login names longer than
         16 letters. It now allows up to 31 letters per name, like it
         should.

       * Fixed #155: Double clicking your avatar triggers a TP
         request. Thanks, Armin!

       * Fixed #184: Opening notecards resets the camera. Thanks,
         Armin!

       * Fixed #197: Windlight toolbar can't be hidden. Thanks, Jacek!

       * Fixed VWR-4232: Some particles don't disappear when UI is
         hidden. Thanks, Admiral Admiral and Mm Alder!

       * Fixed VWR-14267: Clicking send in an IM window does not add
         the sent text to the line editor history. Thanks, Aimee
         Trescothick!

       * Fixed VWR-14278: Gesture auto-completion adds uncommitted
         suggestions to the line editor history. Thanks, Aimee
         Trescothick!

       * Fixed VWR-11172: A source coding mistake prevents number-pad
         keys from specifying Ctrl+digit shortcuts on Windows. Thanks,
         Alissa Sabre!

       * Fixed VWR-14475: Load from XML is broken. Thanks, Admiral
         Admiral and Mm Alder!

       * Fixed VWR-15310: Save to XML doesn't set proper XML tags.
         Thanks, Admiral Admiral and Mm Alder!

       * Fixed SNOW-376: Clean up handling of the maximum length of
         chat messages. Thanks, Admiral Admiral and Mm Alder!

       * Fixed SNOW-413: Potential null pointer exception in
         multi-slider control. Thanks, Admiral Admiral and Mm Alder!

       * Fixed SNOW-488: Malformed animation crash. Thanks, Robin
         Cornelius!

       * Fixed SNOW-492: LLDataPacker::unpackstring() is unsafe.
         Thanks, Robin Cornelius!

       * Fixed a rare crash from textures with too many components.
         (This has only been observed in the Lbsa Plaza sim on OSGrid,
         so far.) Thanks, Armin!


     OTHER CHANGES

       * To help protect our users' privacy, the viewer no longer
         sends "ViewerStats" to Linden Lab's servers. This was a
         feature of the SL viewer which would collect and send various
         pieces of information to Linden Lab without the user's active
         consent. Thanks, Patrick Sapinski!

       * The Linux (32 and 64 bit) builds are no longer distributed
         with Pango or GDK-PixBuf, due to a number of bugs that was
         causing. Linux users should install the following on their
         systems:

          - Pango 1.26 (or compatible), including freetype support.

          - GTK+ 1.16 (or compatible)

       * The "Notify when Linden dollars (L$) spent or received"
         checkbox has been moved to "Preferences > Popups". Thanks,
         McCabe!

       * Removed unnecessary XUI files from the Silver skin. This
         helps keep the UI layouts of both skins in sync. Thanks,
         McCabe!

       * There have been numerous changes and improvements to the
         viewer compile system and software libraries. Thanks to
         Armin, Jacek, McCabe, and Patrick Sapinski, and the Snowglobe
         devs!

   Please see the Imprudence 1.2.0 Release Notes for information about
   the changes in Imprudence 1.2.


   CHANGES

     * Updated OpenAL on Windows to fix error messages flooding the
       logs.

     * Recompiled GStreamer, GStreamer plugins, and liboil on Linux,
       to use the correct version of glibc.

     * libxml2 is now distributed with Imprudence on Linux. It was
       accidently left out of past releases.

   A BRIEF GUIDE TO IMPRUDENCE 1.2

     Imprudence 1.2 adds many new features, fixes, and improvements to
     the viewer experience. Here are a just few of the new features
     and improvements since Imprudence 1.1:

     * Backup your builds, your scripts, and your avatar's shape. If
       you created it, you have the right to back it up or move it to
       a different grid.

     * Double-click Teleport and Autopilot. We've taken the popular
       double-click teleport feature and improved upon it. The default
       behavior can now be set in Preferences > Input & Camera. We've
       also added an ignorable confirmation dialog to reduce the
       chance of accidental teleportations.

     * Improved minimap with built-in radar. The minimap now has
       enhanced zooming and panning, a built-in avatar radar to see
       who is nearby, plus optional chat notices when avatars enter or
       leave chat range or the sim. (Enable minimap notify in
       Preferences > General.)

     * Improved OpenSim support. We've added a list of popular grids
       to connect to, as well as a grid manager so you can add your
       own. You can also enjoy many building benefits when using
       OpenSim, such as the ability to build and edit prims larger
       than 10m on a side!

     * Restrained Life support. Thanks to RLVa by Kitty Barnett,
       Imprudence now supports the Restrained Life API for BDSM items
       and scripted gadgets.

     * Windlight toolbar. We've added a new tab along the bottom of
       the screen for quick access to your Windlight presets and
       certain graphics options. We've also added a variety of
       Windlight presets from Ana Lutetia, CodeBastard Redgrave, and
       Torley Linden!

     * Numerous other features that improve the viewer experience,
       such as double-click to wear attachments in Inventory, optional
       vertical IM tabs (in Preferences > Communication), unread IM
       count, search inventory by creator or description, better
       profile window layout, select default chat channel, Link/Unlink
       in the Build window, sim avatar counts on the World Map, and
       many more.


   KNOWN ISSUES

     * "Advanced > Logout" may cause issues and is unsupported. Use at
       your own risk.

     * If you use the "--loginuri" command line flag, you need to also
       use "--login FirstName LastName Password" to bypass the login
       screen, or your server setting will be ignored.

     * Remaining issues from 1.2.0 beta 2:

        - Property lines for land parcels flash when you have selected
          an avatar in the minimap radar.

        - Many new UI additions only provide English text. We'd love
          to have some bilingual users help us translate them. If you
          can help, please post in the forums.

        - OpenSim 0.6.4 or lower causes the viewer to crash when other
          avatars are present. We strongly encourage all OpenSim grid
          operators to upgrade to OpenSim 0.6.5 or higher.

        - "File > Upload & Import" should have a confirmation dialog
          warning people about how much it will cost to upload all the
          textures.


   CHANGES

     This version of Imprudence includes the following changes, as
     compared to Imprudence 1.2.0 beta 2.


     FEATURES / IMPROVEMENTS

       * Added saving and loading scripts to disk in the script
         editor. Thanks to the Meerkat team for this feature, and
         McCabe for porting it.

       * Added avatar shape Import/Export. You can only export shapes
         that you created and have full perms for. Thanks to the
         Meerkat team for this feature, and McCabe for porting and
         tweaking it.

       * Added an option for vertical IM tabs (Preferences >
         Communication > Vertical IM tabs). Thanks to the Emerald team
         for this feature, and McCabe for porting it.

       * The 'minimap radar can now be hidden via the arrow button in
         the bottom left corner of the minimap. Thanks so much for
         that, Jacek!

       * You can now search inventory by item description (Inventory >
         Search > By Description). Thanks to the Emerald team for this
         feature, and McCabe for porting it.

       * Added new options to configure double-click teleport and
         autopilot in Preferences > Input & Camera, and Disabled
         double-click teleport by default. Thanks, Jacek!

          - For the old "Double-Click Teleport" behavior, set
            Double-Click Action to "Autopilot", and Autopilot Style to
            "Teleport".

          - For the old "Double-Click Autopilot" behavior, set
            Double-Click Action to "Autopilot", and Autopilot Style to
            "Move".

          - Note: Autopilot Style also affects "Go Here/Go To" in the
            pie menu.

       * The Windlight Water window now has next/previous preset
         buttons, like the Sky window does. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Added "Max Particles" slider to the Windlight/Graphics tab on
         the bottom toolbar. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Added Check All/Uncheck All to the Make Outfit window. Thanks
         to the Meerkat team for this feature, and McCabe for porting
         it.

         windows to view your past chat logs with that person/group.
         Thanks to the Emerald team for this feature, and McCabe for
         porting and tweaking it.

       * Updated RLVa to 1.0.5e. Thanks for the update, Kitty Barnett!

       * Raised the World Map maximum teleport height to 4096m (it was
         1000m). Thanks, McCabe!


     BUG FIXES

       * Fixed RLVa not initializing in certain instances. Thanks,
         Kitty Barnett!

       * Fixed copy & paste and file selection dialogs not working for
         some Linux users. Thanks, Jacek!

       * Fixed "avatar_skeleton.xml cannot be parsed" error. You rock,
         Lilly Zenovka!

       * Fixed muting objects with same name as avatar mutes
         ScriptDialogs from avatar. Thanks for the patch, Geneko
         Nemeth!

       * Fixed some Build Math issues, related to the boost library.
         Thanks, McCabe!

       * Fixed Hide Group Titles option not working. Thanks, McCabe
         and Geneko!

       * Partial fix for the parcel border flashing when a name is
         selected in the minimap radar. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Partial fix for avatar names not displaying at heighs above
         1024m. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Set the upper limit of the chat channel selector to 1,000,000
         (1 million) to work around a tricky rounding bug with higher
         channel numbers. To chat on higher channels, use e.g.
         "/1234567890 hi" in chat. Thanks, Jacek!

       * Fixed the login screen's grid selector box displaying the
         wrong grid after logging out. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Fixed grid selection box not updating the splash screen.
         Thanks, McCabe!

       * Fixed some branding issues in alerts and notifications

         Thanks, McCabe!

       * Fixed several compilation errors and warnings. Thanks to
         Geneko and Jacek, and to Alissa Sabre for VWR-12620.

       * Fixed some issues with "Advanced > Consoles > Fast Timers"

     OTHER CHANGES

       * Moved "File > Logout" to the Advanced menu and added a note
         that it's unstable. Use this feature at your own risk!

       * Disable camera constraints also disables constraints when
         zooming out/zooming in and editing appearance. Thanks,
         McCabe!

       * The keyboard shortcut for View > Advanced Menu is now
         Ctrl-Alt-Shift-D on Linux. Mac and Windows shortcuts have not
         changed. Thanks, McCabe!

       * "Go Here" in the pie menu no longer asks for confirmation.
         Thanks, Jacek!

       * Ported the notecard security fix from SL 1.23.5. Thanks to

       * Added "File > Export Selected Objects". Thanks, Jacek!

       * Disabled facelight in Appearance mode when local lighting is
         disabled. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Combined the Mute and Unmute buttons in the minimap radar.
         Good idea, McCabe!

       * Changed the snapshot postcard text not to mention Second
         Life, like Meerkat does. Thanks to McCabe for porting it.

       * Applied patch for VWR-6787 by Alissa Sabre - 'none' text in
         group window not translatable. Thanks, Alissa!

       * Added "Advanced > Allow Multiple Instances" (allow multiple
         copies of Imprudence to run at the same time, for testing
         purposes). Thanks, McCabe!

       * Changed default UIScaleFactor to 1.002 as a workaround to
         some font rendering issues. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Updated the Linux version of fontconfig. Linux users may
         notice some minor differences in font appearance. Thanks,
         Jacek!

       * Updated several other Linux software libraries. Thanks,
         Jacek!

       * Finally packaged up the Mac development libraries. It should
         now be possible for (Intel) Mac users to compile Imprudence
         if they want to. Thanks for finally tackling that, Jacek!

       * Updated and fixed copyright and licensing information for
         many software libraries. Thanks, Jacek!

  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


   ATTENTION: PIE MENU CHANGES

     * The pie menu when right clicking on objects has been rearranged
       slightly:

        - "Buy" now appears in the first menu tier.

        - "Create" has been renamed "Build" and moved to the second
          menu tier.

        - "Return" and "Wear" have new locations in the second menu
          tier.


   KNOWN ISSUES

     * Don't use "File > Logout". It still causes lots of problems:

        - Logging out causes alerts (pop-up dialogs) to not work, and
          may even crash the viewer.

        - Logging out and then logging in to another grid causes the
          Groups window to show groups from both grids.

        - In OpenSim, right clicking clothing in the inventory and
          selecting Edit will cause a crash after logout.

        - Chat sometimes shows up on the login screen after logging
          out.

     * Property lines for land parcels flash when you have selected an
       avatar in the minimap radar.

     * OpenSim 0.6.4 or lower causes the viewer to crash when other
       avatars are present. OpenSim 0.6.6 is recommended.

     * Remaining issues from the previous 1.2.0 beta version:

        - Many new UI additions only provide English text. We'd love
          to have some bilingual users help us translate them. If you
          can help, please post in the forums.

        - The custom chat channel number entry doesn't behave properly
          for channel numbers longer than 6 digits. As a temporary
          work-around until we fix this, use the old "/NUMBER" (e.g.
          "/123456789 Hi") and "//" chat commands for chatting on
          large channel numbers.

        - The grid selection box on the login screen always defaults
          to "secondlife" at startup, when it should default to the
          most recently used grid.

        - The grid selection box on the login screen always shows
          "secondlife" after logging out, but behaves like it is still
          set to the grid you logged out from.

        - The minimap radar cannot be hidden yet. We're working on it.

        - The Windlight Water settings window doesn't have
          previous/next arrows like the Sky window does.

        - The Windlight toolbar sometimes forgets the last selected
          preset.

        - "File > Import" and "File > Upload & Import" may not work
          correctly for Mac users.

        - "File > Upload & Import" should have a confirmation dialog
          warning people about how much it will cost to upload all the
          textures.

     * Note for developers: some Linux and Mac libraries are still not
       packaged/uploaded, which can interfere with compiling
       Imprudence from source. Jacek is working on it!


   CHANGES

     This version of Imprudence includes the following changes (as
     compared to Imprudence 1.2.0 beta).


     BUG FIXES

       * Fixed mouseclicks sometimes "jumping" near the edge of the
         screen in Windows - McCabe Maxsted.

         McCabe Maxsted.

       * Fixed Imprudence wrongly thinking it was on the Teen Grid.

         appearance - Armin Weatherwax.

       * Fixed grid manager adding an unnecessary "/" (forward slash)
         to grid URLs. You should be able to login to the SL Beta
         Grid. (You may need to go into the Grid Manager and remove
         the "/" in the login URI, though.) - Jacek Antonelli.

       * Fixed unlink button enabling when it shouldn't - McCabe
         Maxsted and Kitty Barnett.

       * Fixed inability to unlink when using edit linked parts -
         McCabe Maxsted.

       * Fixed profile size overrunning search window - McCabe
         Maxsted.

       * Fixed UI resize missing reset button in Preferences > General
         - McCabe Maxsted.

       * Fixed (hopefully) UI resize not playing nice with the
         Liberation Sans font - McCabe Maxsted.

       * Fixed newly created notecards behaving oddly - McCabe
         Maxsted.

       * The "Add..." (add friend) button on the minimap is now grayed
         out when you have selected someone who is already your friend
         - McCabe Maxsted.

       * Fixed layout of debug permissions in the tools window -
         McCabe Maxsted.

       * Fixed some compiling issues with Imprudence 1.2 and Windows -
         McCabe Maxsted.

       * Fixed "Join Call" button truncated in group IMs - McCabe
         Maxsted.

       * Fixed reference to "Second Life" in Preferences > Graphics -
         McCabe Maxsted.

       Also, it appears the big crash when logging in/logging out in
       Windows was fixed with the latest LL server update to 1.30.1.


     OTHER CHANGES

       * RLVa version has been updated to 1.0.3e - Kitty Barnett.

       * Muting an avatar now mutes llDialog boxes from them as well -
         McCabe Maxsted.

       * Added llDialog throttle from the Green Life Emerald Viewer.

       * Added clickable Object say/whisper/shout names from the Green
         Life Emerald Viewer.

       * Object IMs are now prefixed with "IM:" in chat - McCabe
         Maxsted.

       * Object IMs now have their own color in Preferences > Text
         Chat - McCabe Maxsted.

       * Minimap now indicates when an avatar is typing - McCabe
         Maxsted.

       * Minimap now announces when an avatar enters chat range
         (enabled by default; you can change this in Preferences >
         General) - McCabe Maxsted.

       * Minimap now announces when an avatar enters the sim (disabled
         by default; you can change this in Preferences > General) -
         McCabe Maxsted.

       * Minimap can now be minimized - McCabe Maxsted.

       * Minimap now shows the selected avatar's icon over other
         icons, so you can see it in crowded areas. - McCabe Maxsted.

       * The minimum value for the Draw Distance slider has been
         lowered to 32m (from 64m) - McCabe Maxsted.

       * Added confirmation alert for double click tping and autopilot
         (can be easily ignored) - McCabe Maxsted.

       * Updated list of graphics cards Imprudence recognizes - McCabe
         Maxsted.

  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


   KNOWN ISSUES

     * When you try to quit after having logged out at least once, the
       viewer may crash (Linux & Mac) or not quit (Windows). As a
       work-around (particularly for Windows users), we recommend not
       using "File > Logout" until this has been fixed.

     * Many new UI additions only provide English text. We'd love to
       have some bilingual users help us translate them. If you can
       help, please post in the forums.

     * The custom chat channel number entry doesn't behave properly
       for channel numbers longer than 6 digits. As a temporary
       work-around until we fix this, use the old "/NUMBER" (e.g.
       "/123456789 Hi") and "//" chat commands for chatting on large
       channel numbers.

     * The grid selection box on the login screen always defaults to
       "secondlife" at startup, when it should default to the most
       recently used grid.

     * The grid selection box on the login screen always shows
       "secondlife" after logging out, but behaves like it is still
       set to the grid you logged out from.

     * The minimap radar cannot be hidden yet. We're working on it.

     * The Windlight Water settings window doesn't have previous/next
       arrows like the Sky window does.

     * The Windlight toolbar sometimes forgets the last selected
       preset.

     * "File > Import" and "File > Upload & Import" may not work
       correctly for Mac users.


   CHANGES

     This version of Imprudence includes the following changes (as
     compared to Imprudence 1.1.0).


     VERSION HIGHLIGHTS

       * Object Backup. You can now download objects that you have
         created and have full permissions for to your computer, and
         upload them back into the world (or another grid). Thanks to
         the Meerkat Viewer for developing this feature, and to Armin
         for helping us import it!

       * Grid Manager. You can now modify the list of grids available
         at the login screen. We have further plans for extending this
         feature, but this will serve for now. Thanks to the Hippo
         Viewer and Meerkat Viewer for this, and to Armin for helping
         import it!

       * Restrained Life support. Imprudence now provides optional
         support for the Restrained Life API (used by BDSM items and
         various scripted gadgets). Enable it with "Advanced >
         Restrained Life Support". Many thanks to Kitty Barnett for
         developing RLVa and working with us to integrate it into
         Imprudence!

       * Radar. The minimap now features a list of nearby avatars.
         Thanks so much, McCabe and Dale Glass!

       * Emerald features. We've imported a variety of features from
         the Green Life Emerald Viewer. Thanks to the Emerald folks
         for developing these, and McCabe for importing them!

          - "Advanced > Asset Browser" (Alt-Shift-A). Visual browser
            for textures in your inventory.

          - "Advanced > Animation List". Lists the animations you are
            playing, and allows you to selectively stop them and revoke
            animation permissions from scripted objects.

          - "Advanced > Phantom Avatar" (Ctrl-Alt-P). Prevents your
            avatar from being pushed, but also prevents you from
            moving.

          - "Advanced > Ground Sit" (Ctrl-Alt-S). Makes your avatar sit
            down at your current location.

          - Build tool shows objects' Last (previous) Owner.

          - When viewing your own profile, the Profile window indicates
            which of your groups are hidden.

          - You can now search your inventory by Creator name.
            ("Search" menu in the Inventory window.)

          - You can now double-click on a location in the 3D world to
            teleport there.

          - Added "BlockClickSit" debug setting. Set it to true to
            prevent yourself from sitting on things when you accidently
            click on them.

          - Particle chat, which sends a message on channel 9000 when
            you select an object, for enhanced integration with
            scripted objects. You can disable this feature by changing
            the "ParticleChat" setting to False in "Advanced > Debug
            Settings".


     BUILDING

       * You can now choose which kind of grass or tree to rez.
         Before, it always rezzed a random kind. Thanks to Mana Janus
         for this!

       * Added "Link" and "Unlink" to the pie menu for objects.
         Thanks, McCabe!

       * Added "Link" and "Unlink" buttons to the Build window.
         Thanks, McCabe!

       * Several changes to the main menus. Thanks, McCabe!

          - "Edit > Duplicate" is now in the Tools menu.

          - Moved the selection-related options in the Tools menu to a
            new submenu, "Tools > Selection Options".

          - The "Tools > Select Tool" submenu has been renamed to
            "Choose Tool" to avoid confusion with the Selection
            Options.

          - "Tools > Set permissions on selected task inventory" has
            been renamed to "Set Bulk Permissions".

       * "Advanced > Rendering > Selected Texture Info" now displays
         partial UUIDs for the textures. Thanks to Henri Beauchamp and
         McCabe for developing this!

       * Added "Tools > Selection Options > Hide Selection Outline"
         (VWR-6918). This can help make it easier to see when editing
         small objects, and improves performance when selecting a
         large number of prims. Thanks a bunch, Aimee Trescothick!


     MAP & MINIMAP

       * The minimap has many improvements. Our enduring gratitude to
         Aimee Trescothick for these!

          - Enhanced zoom behavior and range.

          - It can be panned with Shift-Click and drag. (Right click
            the minimap and disable "Center on Camera" if you want to
            stop it from moving back automatically.)

          - Hovering the mouse over someone's dot on the minimap will
            show their name in the tooltip. Right click on a dot and
            choose "Profile" to open that person's profile window.

          - Window layout converted to XUI under the hood.

       * But wait — the minimap has other improvements, too. Thanks to
         McCabe for these!

          - Muted avatars are colored gray in the minimap.

          - Added "Show World Map" to the minimap right-click menu.

          - Moved "Rotate Mini-Map" to the minimap right-click menu.

       * The World Map displays the number of avatars in each sim,
         above the sim's name. That's pretty handy, Jacek and McCabe!


     MISC. UI

       * The Communicate window title and "IM Received" popup button
         now show the number of unread IMs you've received. Nice work,
         McCabe!

       * The "About Land" window displays the L$/sqm cost for land for
         sale. Thanks to Linden Lab for this feature in SL 1.23.

       * The Resident chooser now has a "Near Me" tab with a list of
         nearby people (VWR-2681). Thanks to Matthew Dowd, Vadim
         Bigbear, and Coco Linden for developing this feature.

       * Double clicking an object in your inventory wears it (or
         detaches it, if you are already wearing it). Thanks to
         Nicholaz Beresford and Henri Beauchamp for developing this!

       * Quick access to Windlight presets and draw distance from the
         toolbar. You can toggle this in "Preferences > Graphics >
         Show environment control in toolbar" (a checkbox near the top
         right corner of the window). Nice work, McCabe!

       * When listening to audio streams, song info is output to your
         chat window. You can toggle this in "Preferences > Audio &
         Video > Show stream info in chat" (a checkbox about halfway
         down the window). Thanks to Dale Glass for developing this
         feature!

       * IM windows inform you when the other person has gone on or
         offline even if you have turned off "Show online Friend
         notifications". That's pretty handy, McCabe!

       * Added "View > Advanced Menu" to toggle the Advanced menu.
         Thanks, Armin!

       * The layout of the Profile window has been revamped. Thanks,
         McCabe!

       * In the Local Chat window, you can now click the name of
         objects that IM you to view information about the object and
         its owner. Thanks to Linden Lab for developing this in SL
         1.23.

       * The Snapshot window can now be minimized. It's the little
         things, McCabe!

       * The Windlight sky settings window now has arrow buttons for
         quickly changing to the previous or next preset in the list.
         Thanks, McCabe!

       * "Show HUD Attachments" has been moved back to the View menu,
         and its shortcut (Alt-Shift-H) has been restored. It was
         moved to the Advanced menu and lost its shortcut in
         Imprudence 1.1. Thanks to mashaeilde on the forums for giving
         us feedback about this!

       * You can now select a default channel number to chat on, for
         interacting with scripted devices. Turn on "Preferences >
         Text Chat > Show custom chat channel" (a checkbox near the
         bottom of the window), then set the channel using the new
         number entry field on the chat bar. Channel 0 is normal chat,
         all other channels are only seen by scripts. You can still
         chat to other channels using "/1", etc. Thanks to the Emerald
         Viewer for the inspiration, and to McCabe for the
         implementation!


     OTHER

       * Imprudence 1.2 has been rebased to SL 1.22.11. Previous
         versions of Imprudence were based on SL 1.21.6. Thanks,
         Jacek!

       * Ability to logout without quitting and restarting the viewer
         (File > Logout). Thanks to the Meerkat Viewer for this!

       * Several bundled software libraries have been updated to new
         versions:

          - Gstreamer, Zlib and Iconv on Windows. Thanks, McCabe!

          - OpenJPEG on Linux. Thanks, Armin!

       * The login screen displays the awesome Imprudence logo while
         the login page is still loading, instead of that smelly old
         SL logo. Way to go, McCabe!

       * Linux-style middle mouse paste on Linux viewers. Thanks,
         Armin!

       * The maximum bandwidth setting has been raised to 5000kbps,
         and the default set to 1000kbps. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Added several new windlight settings by CodeBastard Redgrave,
         Ana Lutetia, and Torley Linden. Thanks, Codie, Ana, and
         Torley!

       * Added the adult_compliant capability, for teleport
         compatibility with Linden Lab's adult content policy. Thanks
         for providing a patch for this, Linden Lab!

       * Added two patches (VWR-11128 and VWR-11138) to support Visual
         Studio Express. Thanks, Robin Cornelius!


     BUG FIXES

       * "Stop All Animations" (aka "Stop Animating My Avatar") only
         affected your own viewer; other people would still see your
         avatar being animated (VWR-2850). Thanks to Tofu Linden for
         fixing that in SL 1.23.

       * The Resident chooser was showing hair instead of calling
         cards. Thanks for fixing that, McCabe!

       * "View > Communicate" wasn't toggling the Communicate window
         like it was supposed to. Thanks for fixing it, McCabe!

       * Small textures weren't being cached (VWR-12686). Thanks for
         fixing that, Robin Cornelius!

       * Certain malformed animations could cause the viewer to abort
         with an assertion about the joint number. Thanks to Linden
         Lab for fixing this in SL 1.23.

       * The chat history window couldn't be minimized. Thanks,
         McCabe!

       * The Contacts window couldn't be toggled with "Edit > Friends"
         (Ctrl-Shift-F) if it was detached from the Communicate window
         (VWR-5370). Thanks to Latif Khalifa for making the patch to
         fix that!

       * When trying to attach multiple objects at once from your
         inventory, it would fail with a message, "Cannot complete
         attachment. An Attachment is pending for that spot". Many
         thanks to Kitty Barnett for fixing that awful bug!

       * Teleporting very long distances on OpenSim Hypergrid would
         sometimes cause weird issues (SVC-2941). Thanks to Mana Janus
         for the fix!

       * Avatars would be invisible until you zoomed in on them (in SL
         1.22). Thanks for the patch to fix this, Aleric Inglewood!

       * Special symbols in group titles were appearing as question
         marks in avatar name tags. McCabe fixed the heck outta that
         one!

  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


   KNOWN ISSUES

     * Mac users may have problems playing some music or video
       streams.

     * Local Chat (aka. Chat History) still stops automatically
       scrolling down to show new chat if you click it at the same
       time as a new line of chat arrives. Manually scrolling down to
       the bottom will start it autoscrolling again.

     * If you come within range of a looped sound while your volume is
       muted, the sound won't play when you unmute your volume. As a
       workaround, move out of range of the sound and then back again
       to trigger it to play.


   CHANGES

     This version of Imprudence includes the following changes (as
     compared to Imprudence 1.1.0 RC2).


     VERSION HIGHLIGHTS

       * Mac Version! Thanks, Jacek!
         (And Thomas Shikami for his OpenAL help!)

       * Improved sound, music, and video support!
         Thanks, McCabe and Jacek!


     UI

            descriptions of all the changes!
            <http://imprudenceviewer.org/wiki/Pie_Menus>

       * Ctrl-D has been reverted to Edit > Duplicate. (It had been
         assigned to World > Create Landmark Here since 1.1.0 RC1.)
         Thanks, Jacek!

       * Added several optional confirmation dialogs (i.e. "Are you
         sure?" popups). Thanks, Jacek!

          - Teleport Home (via keyboard shortcut, the World menu, or
            Map window)

          - Toggle Fullscreen (via keyboard shortcut or the View menu)

          - Take Off All Clothes (via the Edit menu or the pie menu)

          - Restore to Last Position (via the inventory context menu)

          - Mute avatars or objects (via the pie menu or the avatar's
            Profile)

          - Note: All of these can be disabled by checking the
            appropriate box the first time they appear.

       * Added a separator bar between "Wear" and "Restore to Last
         Position" on the inventory context menu. Thanks, Jacek!

       * You can now access the Gestures manager window from the chat
         bar. (IMP-116). Thanks, Armin Weatherwax!

       * The top menu bar no longer turns red when connecting to
         third-party grids. Thanks, McCabe!

       * The login screen now shows pretty pictures like the SL viewer
         does. It will display something Imprudence-specific in the
         future. Thanks, Jacek!


     BUG FIXES

       * Fixed PARCEL_FLAG_ALLOW_CREATE_GROUP_OBJECTS not being
         highlighted in the script editor (VWR-8454). Thanks, McCabe!

       * Fixed a crash when uploading files with non-ASCII characters
         in path on Linux (VWR-5575). Thanks for the patch, Alissa
         Sabre!

       * Fixed two small memory leaks when uploading LSL scripts
         (VWR-9400). Thanks for the patches, Carjay McGinnis and Henri
         Beauchamp!

       * Fixed the "Pay Object" mouse cursor for Linux (it had been
         showing the "Play Media" cursor) (VWR-10829). Thanks, Jacek!

       * Fixed the "High Resolution Snapshot" checkbox being visible
         in cases where it shouldn't have been. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Backported several bug fixes from the SL 1.22 viewer. Thanks,
         McCabe!

          - Fixed: Wrong visualisation of animations (VWR-996).
            Thanks, Unknown Linden!

          - Fixed: Reset Scripts in Selection failed if the parent
            object had no scripts (SVC-2771). Thanks, Si Linden!

          - Fixed: Prim position appears to be wrong (VWR-3871).
            Thanks, Unknown Linden!

          - Fixed: Possible crash in llfloater.cpp.
            Thanks, Unknown Linden!

          - Fixed: Possible crash while changing graphics settings.
            Thanks, Unknown Linden!

          - Fixed: No way to hide IMs in chat console (VWR-3060).
            Thanks for the patch, Henri Beauchamp!

          - Fixed: Texture decoder would try to decode more texture
            channels than the texture had (VWR-4070). Thanks for the
            patch, Carjay McGinnis!


     MISC.

       * Sounds are no longer downloaded if the volume slider is muted
         or zero, to conserve bandwidth, etc. (VWR-11674). Thanks for
         the patch, Zwagoth Klaar!

       * Tons of work under the hood on GStreamer and OpenAL. You
         deserve gold medals, McCabe and Jacek!

  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


   KNOWN ISSUES

     * Mac version is still forthcoming.

     * Viewer freezes permanently when playing streaming media if the
       parcel's media type doesn't match the actual stream type.

     * Viewer may freeze for a few moments when starting or changing
       music or media stream, especially for slow or dead URLs.

     * Streaming music and media may not work for some Vista users.
       Cause is unknown.

     * Local Chat (aka. Chat History) stops automatically scrolling
       down to show new chat if you click it at the same time as a new
       line of chat arrives. Manually scrolling down to the bottom
       will start it autoscrolling again.


   CHANGES

     This version of Imprudence includes the following changes (as
     compared to Imprudence 1.1.0 RC1).


     BUG FIXES

       * Fixed a nasty crash when receiving an IM, when the IM history
         had certain kinds of links in them. Thanks so much for
         finding and fixing that, Anders Arnholm (Balp Allen)!

       * Fixed the viewer crashing when opening the Top Scripts window
         (in the Estate tools). Thanks, McCabe!

       * Fixed certain types of sounds (footsteps/bumps, gestures,
         typing, and others) not being affected by volume controls.
         Thanks, McCabe!

       * Fixed inventory folders repeatedly expanding after using
         Quick Filter. Thanks, Jacek!

       * Fixed the pie menu not showing correct Touch text on scripted
         objects that had used llSetTouchText. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Fixed LSL script syntax highlighting for single line comments
         ("//" style). Thanks, Jacek!

       * Fixed the viewer not asking if you'd like to play streaming
         music. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Streaming media should now work for Linux users running the
         PulseAudio sound server (e.g. Ubuntu users). Thanks, Jacek!


     UI

       * HUD attachments now have a separate pie menu from regular
         attachments, with a layout similar to the pre-1.1.0
         attachments pie menu. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Items in Advanced > Rendering > Features use "Alt-Shift-F#"
         instead of "Ctrl-Alt-F#", to avoid conflicts with Linux
         system keyboard commands. Muchos gracias, McCabe!

       * Removed the Pause button in the music control tab, since it
         had the same effect as Stop anyway. Thanks, McCabe!


     MISC

       * A lot of cleaning and polishing GStreamer stuff under the
         hood. Thanks for all the effort, McCabe!

       * Song title and artist are printed to the debug console when
         music streams change songs. That information will be
         displayed in the UI in a future version. Thanks, Armin
         Weatherwax!

       * The Help > About Imprudence window now lists your version of
         Gstreamer. How handy, McCabe!

  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


   NOTICE: POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE UI CHANGES

     This version contains many changes to the UI, including changes
     to the names and locations of buttons and menu items. You should
     expect the UI (especially the pie menus) to feel awkward at
     first, while your brain and muscle memory adjust to the changes.
     We think you will find the new layouts to be more usable in the
     long run, once the initial re-learning period passes.

     Stick with it! :)


     In particular, please be aware of the following:

     * There have been major reorganization of all pie menus!

     * Some Advanced menu items have been moved to other locations:

        - "Advanced > Rebake Textures" is now "Edit > Refresh
          Appearance".

        - "Advanced > Disable Camera Constraints" is now in the
          "Input/Camera" section of Preferences.

        - "Advanced > High Resolution Snapshots" is now in the
          Snapshot window.

        - "View > Show HUD Attachments" is now "Advanced > Rendering >
          Features > HUD Attachments".

     * Some rarely-used menu items have been removed:

        - "Advanced > Compress Snapshots to disk"

     * Some shortcuts have changed:

        - Added Ctrl-B (View > Web Browser)

        - Added Ctrl-D (World > Create Landmark Here)

        - Removed Shift-Alt-H (View > Show HUD Attachments,
          which has been moved; see above)

     * The "Invite" and "Leave" buttons in the Groups window have
       switched positions (to move "Leave" further away from
       "Activate").

     See the CHANGES section below for details, plus other UI and
     non-UI changes in this version.


   KNOWN ISSUES

     * There is no Mac version! We need a volunteer Mac developer to
       help with this!

     * All platforms still lack voice chat. (But you can add it back
       with a simple trick...)

     * The sub-menus inside the "Advanced > Rendering" menu (i.e.
       Types, Features, Info Displays, and Render Tests) sometimes get
       hidden behind the Advanced menu when they open. This is
       scheduled to be fixed in a future version; in the meantime, you
       can work around it by clicking the tear-off stript at the top
       of the Rendering menu, moving it to the left side of the
       screen, and then opening the desired sub-menu.


   CHANGES

     This version of Imprudence includes the following changes (as
     compared to Imprudence 1.0.0).

     FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS

       * Windows and Linux versions now support sound effects and
         streaming audio and video with OpenAL and Gstreamer! Thanks
         to Tofu Linden for his OpenAL patch, Unknown Linden(s) for
         their Gstreamer work, and McCabe and Jacek for pounding on it
         with hammers!

       * New "Quick Filter" list in the Inventory window. Thanks for
         adding that, Jacek!

       * New "Worn Items" tab in the Inventory window (VWR-2199).
         Thanks for the patch, Vadim Bigbear!

       * New math expressions support in the Build window's Object and
         Texture tabs (VWR-675). Thanks for the patch, Aimee
         Trescothick! See the Build Math Expressions wiki page for
         details and examples for using this cool feature!

     MENUS

       * Reorganized and improved the pie menus a lot (details below).
         Thanks, McCabe!

          - Replaced "Go" with "Inventory" in the pie menu for your
            avatar mesh.

          - Moved "Create" to "More > Build" in the pie menu for
            objects, and moved "Buy" up to the top level. "Take" is
            now always "Take".

          - The pie menu for your own attachments is now more
            consistent with the pie menu for your avatar mesh. This
            helps users with prim-based avatars / lots of
            body-covering attachments. (Attachment-specific options
            are under "More >".)

          - Renamed "Report Abuse..." label to "Abuse..." so it
            doesn't overrun the pie menu.

          - "Mute" option moved from 6 o'clock to avoid accidental
            clicks.

          - Added "Create Landmark" to the pie menu for the ground
            (IMP-38). Thanks for the patch, Armin Weatherwax!

          - Added "Report Abuse" to the pie menu for avatars besides
            yourself (VWR-8179). Thanks for the patch, Asuka Neely!

       * Moved some commonly-used "Advanced" options to more prominent
         locations (details below) (IMP-18). Thanks for doing that,
         McCabe!

          - Moved "Rebake Textures" to "Edit > Refresh Appearance".

          - Moved "Disable Camera Constraints" to be in the
            "Input/Camera" section of Preferences.

          - Moved "High Resolution Snapshots" to the Snapshot window.

       * Added menu item and shortcut to open the built-in web browser
         ("View > Web Browser", Ctrl-B). Thanks, McCabe!

       * Removed "Advanced > Compress Snapshot to disk", since it's
         useless. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Added shortcut (Ctrl-D) to create a new landmark. Also, a
         message, "You created a landmark at _____", will appear in
         chat history when creating a landmark. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Moved "View > Show HUD Attachments" to
         "Advanced > Rendering > Features > HUD Attachments", and
         removed its keyboard shortcut.


     INVENTORY

       * Added "Restore to World" to right click menu on Objects in
         inventory (if the sim supports it) (IMP-36). Thanks, Unknown
         Linden! (This action returns the object to the location
         in-world where it was before being taken / returned to your
         inventory.)

       * Added "Discard" buttons for incoming landmarks, and notecards
         that you created (IMP-30). Thanks for the patches, Henri
         Beauchamp, and thanks to Balp Allen for pointing them out!


     BUILDING

       * High-up prims no longer fall to 256m height when moved
         outworld (VWR-9352). Thanks for the patch, Aimee Trescothick!

       * Fixed Local ruler mode being oriented incorrectly for linked
         objects (VWR-1582). Thanks, Jacek!

       * Added "Tools > Select Only Copyable Objects" menu item.
         Thanks, McCabe!


     MAP / MINIMAP

       * Friends now appear yellow on the minimap (VWR-3336). Thanks
         for the patch, Aimee Trescothick!

       * You can now double-click in the minimap to teleport to that
         location (IMP-34). Thanks for the patch, Armin Weatherwax!

       * The Map window now supports teleports up to a height of 4096m
         (VWR-7331). Thanks for the patch, Peter Lameth!

       * Minimap and Map glyph colors can now be set in colors.xml.
         Thanks, McCabe!


     OTHER UI

       * Added syntax highlighting for C-style comments ("/* ... */")
         in LSL scripts (SVC-2631). Thanks for the patch, Felix
         Duesenburg!

       * Added Home page functionality in the web browser ("Home", "Set
         As Home"). Thanks, McCabe!

       * Clicking "Set As Home" informs you of a successful homepage
         change.

       * Switched the positions of the "Invite" and "Leave" buttons in
         the Groups panel, so the "Leave" button isn't right next to
         the "Activate" button. Thanks, McCabe!

       * The "Offer Teleport" button in the IM window has been moved to
         the left, next to "Profile". Thanks, McCabe!

       * Added "Drag and drop inventory item here to send" text to the
         IM window. That functionality was already present in the SL
         viewer, but almost no one knew about it! Thanks, McCabe!

       * Added an "Ignore" button to friendship requests (VWR-4826).
         Thanks, McCabe!

       * The "invite to group" window now displays the group name in
         the title. Thanks, McCabe!


     MISC

       * Fixed the right/bottom edit arrows on HUDs not working
         (VWR-5518). Thanks for describing the fix, Zi Ree!

       * Fixed avatars being darker than prims; this matches the
         changes in SL 1.22 (VWR-8012). Thanks to CG Linden for
         pointing to the fix!

       * Lip sync for voice chat is enabled by default
         ("Advanced > Character > Enable Lip Sync"). Thanks, McCabe!

       * The colors.xml files (for setting skin colors) now has helpful
         comments describing each entry, to help skin creators. Thanks,
         McCabe!

       * Beacons no longer stay enabled between sessions, to help users
         who accidently enable them. Thanks, McCabe!

       * The wind sound is now disabled by default, and doesn't waste
         CPU time generating white noise when it's off. You can
         re-enable wind by changing the "MuteWind" debug setting to
         FALSE. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Added TGA as an available image format for saving snapshots.
         Thanks, McCabe!

       * llLoadUrl scripts now opens in either the built-in browser or
         your external browser, depending on your preference. Thanks,
         McCabe!

       * The URL highlighter now includes closing parentheses ")" as
         part of the link (VWR-8773). Thanks, Qarl Linden!

       * Windows: Running straight from the .exe uses
         "settings_imprudence.xml" file. Thanks, McCabe!

       * Windows: Crash dump files are named with "Imprudence" instead
         of "Second Life". Thanks yet again, McCabe, you busy beaver!

  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


   KNOWN ISSUES

     * Still no sound or voice yet.

     * Login screen misleadingly displays the last grid you had
       selected even if you use the --loginuri command line option
       (IMP-29).

     * The menus for non-English languages still say "Second Life" in
       some places where they should say "Imprudence" (IMP-27).


   CHANGES

     This version of Imprudence includes the following changes (as
     compared to Imprudence 1.0.0 RC2):

     * Rendering: Windows version ships with OpenJPEG 1.3. This fixes
       the issue of skirts and some uploaded images appearing
       half-transparent. Thanks to McCabe and everyone who helped us
       identify and test that!

     * UI: Added support for displaying a test version identifier
       (e.g. RC2) at the login screen and About Imprudence, to help
       people tell the test versions apart. (Note: you won't see it in
       this release, because this isn't a test version!) Thanks to
       McCabe for adding that!

     * UI: Rebranded the Help menu at the login screen to match the
       main Help menu (IMP-23). Thanks to Balp Allen for reporting
       that, and McCabe for fixing it!

     * UI: The "Release Notes" link in About Imprudence now takes you
       to the release notes on the Imprudence wiki, instead of to a
       bogus page on the Second Life wiki. Thanks to McCabe and Jacek
       for doing that!

     * UI: Grid selector at the login screen no longer has a duplicate
       entry (IMP-24). Thanks to Balp Allen for fixing that!

     * Misc.: Fixed the viewer stupidly creating a 'url_history.xml'
       file in 'C:\' on Windows, and perhaps in '/' (root) on Mac
       (VWR-5808). Thanks to McCabe for fixing that!

     * Code: Patched two small memory leaks when uploading scripts
       (VWR-9400). Thanks to Carjay McGinnis and Henri Beauchamp for
       making those patches!

     * Code: Patched two minor code cleanliness issues (VWR-10759,
       VWR-10837). Thanks to Aleric Inglewood for making those
       patches!




  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


   KNOWN ISSUES

     * Some users have reported that system skirts (not attachments)
       and some uploaded images with alpha channels appear
       partially transparent all over, instead of being opaque
       in some places and transparent in others. You can fix this by
       upgrading to OpenJPEG 1.3. Future Imprudence releases will
       have the new OpenJPEG included in the regular download.

     * The grid selection list on the login screen displays a
       duplicate entry (e.g. two "SL Main Grid" entries). This is
       harmless, and a PITA to fix.

     * Still no sound or voice yet.


   CHANGES

     This version of Imprudence includes the following changes (as
     compared to Imprudence 1.0.0 RC1):

     * Rendering: Applied a likely fix for VWR-8920 (disappearing
       attachments when zoomed in). Please let us know in the forums
       whether this fixes the issue for you. Thanks to an unknown
       Linden for the fix, and to Strife Onizuka for pointing to it!

     * Rendering: Applied a likely fix for VWR-9358 (problems with
       palletized textures). Please
       [http://imprudenceviewer.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=66 let
       us know in the forums] whether this fixes the issue for you.
       Thanks to Angus Boyd for suggesting the fix!

     * Misc UI.: Grid selection list on the login page has been
       embraced and cleaned up. It now lists 3 options: SL Main Grid,
       SL Beta Grid, and Local OpenSim (if you run OpenSim on your
       computer). It will be made customizable in a future version.
       Thanks to Jacek for sprucing that up!

     * Misc: Fixed the debug console window always showing up. Thanks
       to McCabe for fixing it, and to an unknown Linden's testing
       code for causing it in the first place!

     * Misc: Fixed the Windows viewer crashing when clicking on
       certain links in embedded web pages (VWR-4828). Thanks
       to Nyx Linden for pointing to the updated LLMozLib!

     * Misc: Fixed the Windows installer giving an error when
       launching the viewer after installation. Thanks to McCabe for
       fixing that!

     * Misc: Imprudence now uses a separate directory from Second Life
       for storing the cache, settings, and chat logs. This fixes the
       viewer clearing the cache the first time it's run. On Linux,
       it's the '.imprudence' directory in your home directory, and on
       Mac and Windows it's the 'Imprudence' directory in your
       Application Data directory. Thanks to Jacek for doing this!

     * Misc: Fixed the Search window clearing itself out when closed
       and re-opened. Thanks to Samantha Poindexter for reporting the
       problem, to McCabe for fixing it, and to an unknown Linden's
       testing code for causing it in the first place!

     * Building: Fixed the Silver skin's Build floater not matching
       the one from the Classic skin. Thanks to Damien Fate for
       reporting the problem, and to Jacek for fixing it!

     * Code: Fixed several bits of sloppy Linden code that blocked
       compiling with gcc 4.3. Thanks to Alissa Sabre for suggesting
       the fix to VWR-9507, and Stephen Zenith for patches
       IMP-11 and IMP-12!

     * Misc UI.: Changed Group UI to use "Resident" or "Member"
       instead of "Person", for consistency (VWR-9007).
       Thanks to McCabe for sprucing that up!

   WHAT TO EXPECT

    * Many small usability improvements.

      The goal of Imprudence is to make significant usability
      improvements over the standard SL viewer, but for this first
      release our focus has simply been to get the project
      established. You'll find many small improvements scattered
      throughout the viewer, almost all of them programmed by SL
      Residents and submitted as patches to JIRA, but which LL has not
      (at least yet) accepted. Future versions of Imprudence will
      feature more significant improvements made specifically for this
      project.

    * New fonts.

      Imprudence uses different fonts than regular SL, because SL's
      fonts are proprietary and very expensive to license. The new
      fonts might make things seem "not quite right" at first, since
      your eye expects the old font you normally see in SL. We do
      think you'll enjoy the new fonts once you get used to them. (For
      the curious, the fonts used are Liberation Sans for the UI, and
      Bitstream Vera Mono for the script editor.)

    * No sound or voice.

      This release of Imprudence doesn't have any sound or voice
      support, because the software libraries SL uses for those things
      are proprietary and can't be used with open-source viewers. We
      hope to add back sound support using OpenAL for the next version
      of Imprudence. We're not sure yet when we'll be able to add
      voice back in.

    * Slightly slower texture loading.

      Textures may load slightly slower than they do in regular SL.
      Once again, this is because the texture software library SL uses
      by default (Kakadu / KDU) is proprietary, so we're using
      OpenJPEG, which is open source but not quite as speedy. The
      difference shouldn't be a major issue.


  CHANGES

    This version of Imprudence includes the following changes (as
    compared to Second Life viewer 1.21.6):

    * Building: You can now "Slice" (aka. Dimple / Profile Cut) the
      Box, Cylinder, and Prism prim types directly, without needing to
      switch to Sphere and back. (VWR-7827; thanks McCabe Maxsted!)

    * Stability: Several patches by Nicholaz Beresford to fix memory
      leaks and improve stability. (VWR-2003, VWR-2683, VWR-2685,
      VWR-3877, and VWR-3878; thanks Nicholaz!)

    * Misc.: The "Advanced" menu is now written in XUI, so you can
      edit shortcuts in that menu by editing the XML file, instead of
      needing to recompile the viewer from source. (Note: The file to
      edit is skins/default/xui/en-us/menu_viewer.xml) (VWR-2896;
      thanks Jacek Antonelli!)

    * Social: Added "Invite..." button to the Groups section of the
      Communicate panel, to make it easier to invite people to the
      selected group. (VWR-8024; thanks McCabe Maxsted!)

    * Building: Up and down arrows change Path Cut / Profile Cut by
      increments of 0.025 instead of 0.05, to make it easier to
      path-cut boxes in half, etc. (VWR-7877; thanks McCabe Maxsted!)

    * Misc. UI: Added "Return Object" to the Tools menu, to make it
      easier to return objects that are hard to right-click on.
      (VWR-1363; thanks McCabe Maxsted!)

    * Social: Added "Offer Teleport" button to the IM window.
      (VWR-2072; thanks Paul Churchill!)

    * Building: Added "Tools > Set permissions on selected task
      inventory" menu item, to set perms on multiple in-world objects
      and/or their contents. This will have a nicer UI later.
      (VWR-5082; thanks Michelle2 Zenovka!)

    * Misc. UI: Several usability and UI layout improvements to the
      land tools floater. (VWR-8430; thanks Aimee Trescothick!)

    * Misc. UI: Added "Flycam" button that appears when you are in
      flycam mode (using a joystick or SpaceNavigator); click it to
      cancel flycam mode. (VWR-8341; thanks Aimee Trescothick!)

    * Building: Rephrased "Select Texture" to the more accurate and
      descriptive phrase "Select Faces to Texture". (Inspired by
      VWR-5962; thanks McCabe Maxsted and Jacek Antonelli!)

    * Building: Increased maximum settable transparency from 90% to
      100% in the Textures tab. (Thanks Jacek Antonelli!)

    * Social: "Offer Teleport" buttons throughough the UI are now
      always clickable, even for avatars who are not on your friends
      list or who appear offline. (Thanks Jacek Antonelli!)

    * Misc.: Changed the application name, logo, login page, etc. to
      Imprudence.

    * Misc.: Imprudence has its own version numbers, starting at
      1.0.0. Use "Help > About Imprudence" to check the SL source
      version it's based on.

    * Misc.: Disabled FMOD, KDU, and Vivox (SLVoice) proprietary
      software.

    * Misc.: Changed fonts to Liberation Sans and Bitstream Vera Mono.


   KNOWN ISSUES

    * Windows: At the end of the installer, if you leave the "Launch
      Imprudence Viewer" checkbox enabled and press "Finish", you will
      receive an error message and it will not automatically start the
      viewer. But this does not harm anything, and starting the viewer
      yourself (e.g. from the desktop shortcut) should work fine.

    * Windows: When the viewer is started, a text console window will
      appear displaying debug information, and then be covered by the
      main viewer window. This will be disabled in future releases.
      You can disable it manually by opening "Advanced > Debug
      Settings" and changing "ShowConsoleWindow" to false, then
      restarting the viewer.

    * Windows: The viewer may crash when clicking links in embedded
      web pages, including certain sections of the Search window and
      the "Web" section of avatar profiles. We hope to fix this in the
      future. To work around it for now, just avoid clicking on links
      in embedded web pages in the viewer.

    * All Platforms: The viewer may be (very) slow to start the first
      time, as it clears the cache.

    * All Platforms: When using the Silver skin, the Tools (aka Build)
      floater doesn't have the new features (e.g. transparency up to
      100%, smaller path cut increment), and improperly displays the
      land tools brush size combo box on every build tab.
